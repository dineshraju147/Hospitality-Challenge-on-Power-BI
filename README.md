# Codebasics - Hospitality Challenge

## Project Overview
Atliq Grands, a leading five-star hotel chain in India, has been facing challenges due to competition and ineffective decision-making. To regain market share and revenue, the company has decided to integrate Business and Data Intelligence. As part of this initiative, I have developed an insights-driven Power BI dashboard to assist the revenue management team in making data-driven decisions.

## Insights & Key Findings
The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into revenue trends, booking behaviors, and customer satisfaction. Key takeaways include:
- **Elite customers** drive revenue significantly and should be the primary focus across cities.
- **RT2 Room Type** contributes the most to revenue, making it a priority for optimization.
- **MakeMyTrip and LogTrip** platforms require stronger partnerships to increase bookings.
- **Last two weekends of the month** need strategic planning to balance realized revenue.
- **Revenue dropped by 28.17%** in the last four days of the month.
- **Mumbai contributes 13.59%** of total revenue.
- **June had the highest cancellation rate (25.09%)**, which lowered the occupancy rate by 0.24%.
- **Atliq Blu had the highest average rating**, outperforming Atliq Seasons by 72.54%.

## Developed Dashboards
The Power BI solution includes four key dashboards:
1. **Overall Analysis Dashboard** - Provides a high-level summary of key metrics and performance.
2. **Revenue Analysis Dashboard** - Focuses on revenue trends, revenue loss, and booking sources.
3. **Booking Analysis Dashboard** - Analyzes booking trends, cancellations, and occupancy rates.
4. **Rating Analysis Dashboard** - Evaluates customer ratings across different properties.

## Key KPIs Developed Using DAX
- **Total Bookings**
- **Total Revenue**
- **Average Rating**
- **Total Capacity**
- **Total Successful Bookings**
- **Occupancy Percentage**
- **Total Cancelled Bookings**
- **Cancellation Rate**
- **Revenue Loss**
- **Total Stay Duration**

## Key Learnings
This project has been an enriching experience, providing valuable insights into data storytelling and visualization. Some key takeaways:
- Understanding **business requirements** and translating them into actionable insights.
- Utilizing **drill-through filters** for more in-depth analysis.
- Exploring **DAX measures** to create meaningful KPIs.
